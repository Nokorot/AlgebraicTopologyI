\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]

\item[(b)]
The fact that the two boundary points are mapped to the base point follows from
\[ d_0(g) = \{1\} = d_1(g). \]

Let $\delta_i: [n-1] \to [n]$, be the face map such that $\delta_i^* = d_i$.
Then
\[ (BG)_1 \times \nb^1 \ni (g,0) = (g,{\delta_0}_*(1)) \sim (d_0(g),1) = (1,1)
\in (BG)_0\times \nb^1, \]
so $(g,1) \in \{g\}\times \nb^1$ is mapped to $(g,0) = (1,1)$ in $|BG|$.
Similarly
\[ (g,1) = (g,(\delta_1)_*(1)) \sim (d_1(g),1) = (1,1), \]
so also $(g,1) \in \{g\}\times \nb^1$ is mapped to $(g,1) = (1,1)$ in $|BG|$.

\item[(c)]
Let $g,h \in G$ and $\eta(g,h) : \nb^2 \to |BG|$ defined by the composition
\[ \{ (g,h) \}\times \nb^2 \into \bigcup_{n\ge 0} (BG)_n \times \nb^n \onto
|BG|. \]

Like in (b), let $d_i = \delta_i^*$. Then
\[
\delta_0; \pwf{0\mapsto 1 \\ 1 \mapsto 2} \quad
\delta_1; \pwf{0\mapsto 0 \\ 1 \mapsto 2} \quad
\delta_2; \pwf{0\mapsto 0 \\ 1 \mapsto 1}
\]

So for $t\in \nb^2$, we have
\[ \omega(g)(t) = (g,t) = (d_0(g,h), t) \sim
((g,h),(\delta_0)_*(t)) = (\eta(g,h) (\delta_0)_*)(t), \]
and similarly
\[ \omega(h)(t) = (\eta(g,h) (\delta_2)_*)(t) \qq\tand
\omega(g\cdot h)(t) = (\eta(g,h) (\delta_1)_*)(t), \]
So $\omega$ on $g,h$ and $gh$ correspond to the loops defined $\eta$ restricted
to the three faces as illustrated in figure \pref{fig:1}

Also illustrated in the figure, by the cyan curves, $\eta(g,h)$ defines a
homotopy from $\omega(g)\cdot \omega(h)$ to $\omega(g\cdot h)$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
Consider $S^1 = [0,1] / (0\sim 1)$. And let $U_1 = (0,1) \ss S^1$ and $U_2 =
[0,1] \setminus \{1/2\} \ss S^1$. Then $\{ U_i \}$ is a cover of $S^1$ and we claim that
$p^{-1}(U_i) \cong F \times U_i$.

In the case of $i=1$ this is clear and for $i=2$ we have
\begin{align*}
p\i (U_2) &\cong \left( F\times [0,1/2) \sqcup F \times (1/2,1] \right) /
\left( (x,0) \sim (f(x),1) \right) \\
&\cong_\phi \left( F\times [0,1/2) \sqcup F \times (1/2,1] \right) /
\left( (x,0) \sim (x,1) \right) \\
&\cong F \times U_2
\end{align*}
where $\phi = \id_F \times \id \sqcup f^{-1} \times \id$. $\phi$ is well-defined
since $\id(x) = x = f^{-1}(f(x))$ and it is clearly a homeomorphism.

\item[(b)]
\begin{lemma}
Let $\pi: E \to [0,1]$ be a fibre bundle, the $\pi$ is trivial. That is
$E \cong F \times [0,1]$. (Here $F$ is the unique fibre. Unique since $[0,1]$ is
connected.)
\end{lemma}


%\newcommand{\Bes}{[s-\eps,s+\eps]}
%\newcommand{\Bes}{\bar B(s,\eps)}
\newcommand{\Bes}{I_{s,\eps}}

\begin{proof}
Let $S = \{s\in[0,1] \q| \pi\i([0,s]) \cong F \times [0,s] \}$. We want to show
that $S$ is both closed and open and thus equal to $[0,1]$.

We start with open. Let $s \in S$, then since $\pi$ is a fiblre bundle there
exists an open neigboorhood $V\ni s$, such that $\pi\i(V) \cong F \times V$.
Let $\eps > 0$, such that $\Bes \ss V$ (closed ball centred at $s$ with
radius $\eps$, ie. $\Bes = [s-\eps, s+\eps]$.)

Since $s \in S$, there exists $f_s: \pi\i([0,s]) \congto F\times [0,s]$. And by
restricting the homeomorphism assosiated to $V$, we have $g: \pi\i(\Bes) \congto F
\times \Bes$.

We want to make $g$ and $f$ agree on the intersection, so we define a map to
make up for the difference. Define $\til g: F\times \Bes \to F\times\Bes$ by
\[ \til g(f,t) := \pwf{
(f_t \circ g_t\i)(f) &\tif t\in[s-\eps, s], \\
(f_s \circ g_s\i)(f) &\tif t\in[s, s+\eps] } \]
where $f_t : F \to F$ is the map $f$ resticted to the fiber over $t$.
$\til g$ is clearly well-defined and continues, since $g$ is a homeomorphim
m and
both $g$ and $f$ maps the fiber over $t$ to itself, by the definition of a fiber
bundle.

We observe that $\til g\circ g|_{\pi\i([s-t,s])} = f|_{\pi\i([s-t,s])}$. So
the following map is well defined. Define $\til f: \pi\i([0,s+\eps]) \to F\times
[0,s+\eps]$ by
\[ x \mapsto \pwf{
f(x) &\tif \pi(x) \in [0,s], \\
(\til g \circ g)(x) &\tif \pi(x) \in [s-\eps,s+\eps] } \]

It is quite clear that this defines a homeomorphism, so $s + \eps \in S$ and
thus $S$ is open.
% This clearly defines a homeomorphism on the fibers and by our observation above
% it is well-defined. It is also clear that

\todo{prove that $S$ is closed}
\end{proof}

Let $p : E \to S^1$ be a fibre bundle with fibre $F$ ($S^1$ is connected), and
$U_1 = [0, 1/2] \ss S^1$ and $U_2 = ([1/2,1]) \ss S^1$. Then, for $i=1,2$, 
$p_i = p|_{p\i(U_i)} : p\i(U_i) \to U_i$ defines fibre bundle over the closed
interval $U_i$. So by the lemma above, $p_i$ is trivial. Let $f_i : p\i(U_i)
\congto F \times U_i$.

The two intervals overlap on exactly on the points $0 \sim 1$ and $1/2$. We define
the difference maps $\xi_1, \xi_2: F \to F$ by
\[ \xi_1 = f_2 \circ f_1\i(-,0) \qq\tand
\xi_2 = f_1 \circ f_2\i(-,1/2). \]

Clearly both $\xi_1$ and $\xi_2$ defines homeomorphisms. We want to modify $f_2$
such that it agrees with $f_1$ over the point $1/2$.
Let $\til f = (\xi_2 \times \id) \circ f_2$. Then by constuction $\til f$ and
$f_1$ agrees over the point $1/2$. Furthermore $f_2 = \xi_1 \circ (f_1)_0$
(where $\cdot_0$ means over the point $0\sim 1$), so
\[ (\til f)_0 = \xi_2 \circ \xi_1 \circ (f_1)_0. \]
Let $\xi = \xi_2 \circ \xi_1$, then $E \cong T_\xi$, by the map $f : E \congto
T_\xi$ defined by the compositon
\[ E \xto{ f_1 \sqcup_{1/2} \til f_2 } F \times [0,1]
\xto{quationt} T_\xi. \]
