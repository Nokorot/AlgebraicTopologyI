\begin{exercise}[1]\ 

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] 
Given $\alpha: A \to X$, $\beta : C \to Y$ and $(p : X\to Y) \in \Eps$, such
that the outer square in the following diagram commutes
\[ \begin{tikzcd}
A \ar[r,"\alpha"] \ar[d, "j \circ i"'] 
& X \ar[d, "p"] \\
B \ar[r, "\beta"'] \ar[ru, dotted, "\lambda"]
& Y
\end{tikzcd} \]
We want to construct the map $\lambda: C \to X$, such that the hole diagram
commutes.

Since $i \in \Eps^\orth$ we have the lift $\lambda' : B \to X$, such that 
\[ \begin{tikzcd}
A \ar[r,"\alpha"] \ar[d, "i"'] 
& X \ar[d, "p"] \\
B \ar[r, "\beta \circ j"'] \ar[ru, dotted, "\lambda'"]
& Y
\end{tikzcd} \]
commutes. Since also $j\in \Eps^\orth$ we have the lift $\lambda$, such that 
\[ \begin{tikzcd}
A \ar[r,"\lambda'"] \ar[d, "j"'] 
& X \ar[d, "p"] \\
C \ar[r, "\beta"'] \ar[ru, dotted, "\lambda"]
& Y
\end{tikzcd} \]
commutes. It is clear that this lambda makes the original diagram commute.

\item[(b)]
We consider the following diagram.
\[ \begin{tikzcd}
A \ar[r, "\alpha"] \ar[rr, bend left, "\beta \circ \alpha"] 
\ar[d, "i"'] 
& C \ar[r, "\beta"] \ar[d, "j"'] 
& X \ar[d, "p"]
\\ 
B \ar[r, "\gamma"] \ar[rr, bend right, "\delta \circ \gamma"'] 
& D \ar[r, "\delta"] 
\ar[ru, dotted, "\lambda"]
& Y
\end{tikzcd} \]
where $p\in \Eps$ and $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ and $\delta$ are such that
the solid diagram commutes. 
We want to define $\lambda : D \to X$ such that the
full diagram commutes.

Since $i \in \Eps^\orth$, we have $\lambda' : B \to X$, with respect to the
outer square of the diagram. With that we consider the following diagram
\[ \begin{tikzcd}
A \ar[r,"\alpha"] \ar[d, "i"] 
& C \ar[d, "j"] \ar[rdd, bend left, "\beta"] 
& \\
B \ar[r, "\gamma"] \ar[rrd, bend right, "\lambda'"] 
& D \ar[rd, dotted, "\lambda"]
& \\ 
& & X
\end{tikzcd} \]
The solid part commutes by the previous diagram and we get a unique map 
$\lambda : D \to X$, by the universal property of the push out making the full
diagram commute.

It is clear that this is the map we want.
\item[(c)]
Let $p\in \Eps$, $\alpha: C \to X$ and $\beta: D \to Y$, such that the solid
part of the following diagram commutes.
\[ \begin{tikzcd}
C \ar[r,"\alpha"] \ar[d, "j"'] 
& X \ar[d, "p"] \\
D \ar[r, "\beta"'] \ar[ru, dotted, "\lambda"]
& Y
\end{tikzcd} \]
We want to define $\lambda$ such that the full diagram commutes.

We consider the following diagram
\[ \begin{tikzcd}
C \ar[r, "s"] \ar[rr, bend left, "\id"] \ar[d, "j"]
& A \ar[r, "r"] \ar[d, "i"] 
& C \ar[r, "\alpha"] \ar[d, "j"]
& X \ar[d, "p"] 
\\
D \ar[r, "t"'] \ar[rr, bend right, "\id"'] 
& B \ar[r, "u"'] \ar[rru, dotted, "\lambda'" near start] 
& D \ar[r, "\beta"']
& Y
\end{tikzcd} \]
The solid part clearly commutes and thus, since $i\in \Eps^\orth$, we get the
map $\lambda'$, such that the full diagram commutes.

It is clear that $\lambda = \lambda' \circ t$ gives us the map we want, by
considering the outermost square in the previous diagram.

\item[(d)]
Let $\alpha : A_0 \to X$, $\beta : A:=\colim_n A_n \to Y$ and $(p : X \to Y)
\in \Eps$, such that the solid part of the following diagram commutes
\[ \begin{tikzcd}
A_0 \ar[r,"\alpha"] \ar[d, "\hat i_0"'] 
& X \ar[d, "p"] \\
A \ar[r, "\beta"'] \ar[ru, dotted, "\lambda"]
& Y
\end{tikzcd} \]
where $\hat i_0 : A_0 \to A$ is the canonical morphism.
We want to define $\lambda$ so that the full diagram commutes.

By the left lifting property of the sequential maps $i_j : A_j \to A_{j+1}$,
(for $j= 0,1,...$). Let $\lambda_j = \alpha$, then we will inductively define
maps $\lambda_j : A_j \to X$ such that the following diagram commutes.
\[ \begin{tikzcd}
A_j \ar[r,"\lambda_j"] \ar[d, "i_j"'] 
& X \ar[d, "p"] \\
A_{j+1} \ar[r, "\beta \circ \hat i_{j+1}"'] \ar[ru, dotted, "\lambda_{j+1}"]
& Y
\end{tikzcd} \]
The commutativity of the solid square follows by the inductive hypothesize,
(and the definition of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in the case of $j=0$) and the existence
of the map $\lambda_{j+1}$ follows since $i_j \in \Eps^\orth$. 

It is imminently clear from the inductive construction that $\lambda_{j+1}
\circ i_j = \lambda_j$, so by the universal property of the commit, 
there is a unique map $\lambda : A \to X$ such that 
$\lambda_j = \lambda \circ \hat i_j$.

It follows by the defining property of $\lambda_1$ (and $\lambda$) that 
\[ \begin{tikzcd}[row sep = 4em]
A_0 \ar[rr,"\alpha"] \ar[d, "i_0"'] &
& X \ar[d, "p"] \\
A_1 \ar[r, "\hat i_1"'] \ar[rru, "\lambda_1"]
& A \ar[r, "\beta"'] \ar[ru, "\lambda"]
& Y
\end{tikzcd} \]
commutes. So $\lambda$ is the map that we want, since $\hat i_0 = \hat i_1
\circ i_0$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{exercise}[2]\ 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(C1)] 
It is immediately clear that isomorphisms are acyclic and that $\emptyset \to X$
is a cofibration. Furthermore, a $h$-cofibration is defined by the left lifting
property with respect to the class $\Eps := \{ p_0 : Y^I \to I \}$. So it
follows by exercise 1 (a), that $h$-cofibration are stable under composition.

\item[(C2)]
The two out of three property, follows from the fact that weak equivalences are
characterized by being sent to isomorphism by some functor (that is $\pi_*$),
since the class of isomorphisms satisfy the two out of three property.

\item[(C3)]
It follows by exercise 1 (b), it follows that $h$-cofibration are stable under
cobase change. 
% TODO: weak equvalences

\item[(C4)]
For $f: A \to B$, we may form the mapping cylinder $Cf = (A \times [0,1]) \cup_f
B$ and we have 
\[ \begin{tikzcd}
A \ar[r, rightarrowtail, "i_0"] \ar[rr, bend right, "f"']
& Cf \ar[r, "p", "\sim"'] 
& B 
\end{tikzcd} \]
We showed last year that $i_0$ is a $h-cofibration and it is clear that $p$ is
a homotopy eqvivalence and thus a weak eqvivalenece.
\end{enumerate}

\item[(b)] 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(C1)] 
Again it is clear that isomorphisms are acyclic and $\emptyset \to X$ is a
cofibration. It is also clear that cofibrations are stable under composition.

\item[(C2)] 
The two out of three is also clear, by it also follows by part (a), by
the same argument, that is weak eqvalences are characterized by being mapped to
weak equvalences geometric realizarton.

\item[(C3)] 
%% TODO

% The part regarding the weak equivalences follows by geometric realization
% argument.

\item[(C4)]
For the factorization, we have agian the mapping cylinder, 
$Cf = (X\times \Delta^1) \cup_f Y$, for any map $f: X \to Y$. We have 

\[ \begin{tikzcd}
X \ar[r, rightarrowtail, "i_0"] \ar[rr, bend right, "f"']
& Cf \ar[r, "p", "\sim"'] 
& Y 
\end{tikzcd} \]
It is quite easy to see that $i_0$ is a monomorphism. Furthermore, the geometric
realization of $Cf$ is the mapping cylinder of topological spaces, so it is
clear that $p$ is a weak eqvivalence.

\end{enumerate}

\item[(c)] 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(C1)] 
Isomorphisms are clearly acyclic again, and monomorphisms are stabile under
composition.

\item[(C2)] 
It is also clear that monomorphisms satisfy two out of three.
