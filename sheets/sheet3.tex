Let $f:S^{n+k} \to X_n$ be a representative of an element in $\pi_k(X)$.
Since $\Sigma_m$Â acts trivially on $X_m$ for infinitely many $m$, we may assume
wlog, that for $\Sigma_{n+2}$ acts trivially on $X_{n+2}$. 
% We have that 
So by $\Sigma_2 \times \Sigma_n$-equivariance of $\sigma^2$, the map
\[ \sigma^2 \circ (S^2 \smash f) : S^2 \smash S^n \to X_{2+n} \]
factors through the quotient space the action $\Sigma_2 \times
\Sigma_n$-action on. In particular it factors through the quotient space of the
$\Sigma_2$-action on $S^2$, which is isomorphic to $D^2$. However, $D^2$ is
contractible and the smash product with a contractible space is contractible.
So, in other words,
$\sigma^2 \circ (S^2 \smash f)$ factors through a contractible space, and thus 
$[f] = [\sigma_n \circ (S^2 \smash f)] = 0$.
