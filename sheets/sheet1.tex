\begin{exercise}[1 \& 2]\ 
% Let $Y$ be a pointed space, $m \ge 1$ and $f:S^m \to S^m$ a continuous based
% map of degree $k$. Show that for every homotopy class $x \in \pi_n(S^m \wedge Y
% )$ the classes $(f\wedge Y)^*(x)$ and $k\cdot x$ become equal in
% $\pi_{1+n}(S^{1+m}\wedge Y)$ after applying the suspension homomorphism.
% Give an example to show that $(f\wedge Y)^*(x)$ need not equal $k\cdot x$ in
% $\pi_n(S^m\wedge Y)$ before applying the suspension homomorphism.

We will denote the degree $k$ map, by $f_m : S^m \to S^m$. 

Let $x = [\phi : S^n \to S^m \wedge Y]$. 
We consider the (no necessarily commuting) diagram 
\[ \begin{tikzcd}
S^n \arrow[r, "\phi"] \arrow[d, "f_n"]& S^m \wedge Y \arrow[d, "f_m \wedge Y"]
\\
S^n \arrow[r, "\phi"] & S^m \wedge Y
\end{tikzcd}  \]
Where $[ (f_m \wedge Y) \circ \phi ] = (f\wedge Y)_*(x)$ and $[ \phi \circ f_n ]
= k \cdot x$. 

Applying the suspension functor, this diagram is sent to 
\[ \begin{tikzcd}
S^1 \wedge S^n \arrow[r, "S^1 \wedge \phi"] \arrow[d, "S^1 \wedge f_n"]& S^1 \wedge S^m \wedge Y \arrow[d, "S^1 \wedge f_m \wedge Y"]
\\
S^1 \wedge S^n \arrow[r, "S^1 \wedge \phi"] & S^1 \wedge S^m \wedge Y
\end{tikzcd}  \]
We want to show that this diagram commutes up to homotopy.

We observe that the map $S^m \wedge f_1 : S^{m+1} \to S^{m+1}$ is a $k$-fold
map. Since $(S^m \wedge -)_*$ is isomorphism of homology groups, we have $(S^m
\wedge -)_*([f_1]) = [S^m \wedge f_1] = k \in H^{m+1}$, so by the Hurwitz's theorem $[S^m \wedge f_1] = k \in \pi_{m+1}(S^{m+1})$.
So we may wlog assume $f_m = S^{m-1} \wedge f_1$. 
Furthermore the map $\tau : S^1 \wedge S^1 \to S^1 \wedge S^1$, which swaps the two
spheres, is base homotopic to the identify. So identifying $S^n$ with
$\Wedge_{i=1}^n S^1$, the diagram can be written, up to homotopy, as 
\[ \begin{tikzcd}
S^1 \wedge S^n \arrow[r, "S^1 \wedge \phi"] \arrow[d, "f_1 \wedge S^n"]& S^1 \wedge S^m \wedge Y \arrow[d, " f_1 \wedge S^m \wedge Y"]
\\
S^1 \wedge S^n \arrow[r, "S^1 \wedge \phi"] & S^1 \wedge S^m \wedge Y
\end{tikzcd}  \]
which clearly commutes.

For the counter example we consider the example given in question 2. 
In question 2 we have the commutative diagram

\begin{equation}
\label{dgr:1}
\begin{tikzcd}
S^3 \arrow[r, "\eta"] \arrow[d, "g"] & \C P^1 \arrow[d, "f"] \\
S^3 \arrow[r, "\eta"] & \C P^1 
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}

The map $f$ has degree $-1$ and the map $g$ had degree $1$. So if we suppose 
the two classes are the same without suspension, then 
\[ -[\eta] = (f \wedge S^0)_* ([\eta]) = [ \eta \circ g ] = [\eta] \quad\in
\pi_3(S^2, *), \]
where the second equality follows form the commutativity of the diagram
\pref{dgr:1}. However $-[\eta] \ne [\eta]$ in $\pi_3(S^2, *) = \Z$, so this is a contradiction.

On the other hand, by suspending the diagram \pref{dgr:1} and using the fact
from exercise 1, that $\Sigma_* (-[\eta]) = \Sigma_* ( (f \wedge S^0)_* ([\eta])
)$, we get that 
\[ -\Sigma_*[\eta] = \Sigma_* [ \eta \circ g ] = \Sigma_* [\eta]
\quad\in\pi_4(S^3,*). \]
So we may conclude that $2 \cdot (\Sigma_*[\eta]) = 0 \in \pi_4(S^3, *)$.
